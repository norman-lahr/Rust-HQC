//! Errors returned by the public API.

//! The crate previously had no error type: every failure was a panic. That is
//! unacceptable for the Botan binding, because a panic unwinding across an
//! `extern "C"` boundary is undefined behaviour. Every public entry point now
//! returns [`Result`], and the internal `assert!`s that remain are invariants
//! the public layer checks up front so they cannot be reached from outside.
